# MITAG-Site

This repository is based on a old version of the <em>SwiftPage</em> project, which can be found here: https://github.com/magj3k/swiftpage

This project is intended to make updating the MITAG website very easy (doable without HTML/CSS/Javascript coding knowledge).

- To update the site, change ` create_site.py ` to include the elements you want (i.e. image galleries, headers, Vimeo links).
- Next, run ` create_site.py ` to regenerate the entire website in-place.
- Then, you can transfer the site's files as necessary to any hosting services or servers appropriately.
